# -Vehicle-Counter
Here, we will count the number of vehicle when it crosses the line, we have also created a point in the vehicle for counting when that point on the vehicle crosswes the line.  Here, if the vehicle is not detected at the time when the vehicle point is crossing the line then that vehicle will not be counted. We have used Yolo, cv2, cvzone.
